Fake Edge App: A PowerShell Script to Create a Fake PWA App #In today\u0026rsquo;s digital world, quick and easy access to specific websites can be incredibly useful. One way to achieve this is by creating a Progressive Web App in Microsoft Edge. However this does not work for every site. For Example Microsoft Forms.\nIn this blog post, I show you a PowerShell script that does just that: it creates a desktop shortcut that opens a specific webpage in a \u0026ldquo;Fake\u0026rdquo; Edge App window.\nOverview of the Script #The script we present here creates a desktop shortcut that opens a specific URL in an Edge window. The window is configured to look like a standalone application, which can be particularly useful for frequently accessed web applications.\nScript Details #Here is the complete code of the script:\n\u0026lt;# .Synopsis Creates a \u0026#34;Fake\u0026#34; Edge App .INPUTS Change $websiteURL, $shortcutPath, $logFile, $icoPath, $icoDestinationPath .OUTPUTS $logFile Path Transcript #\u0026gt; # URL $websiteURL = \u0026#34;google.de\u0026#34; # Get the path to the Public Desktop folder using the special folder identifier $publicDesktopPath = [System.Environment]::GetFolderPath(\u0026#39;CommonDesktopDirectory\u0026#39;) # Define the path to the shortcut $shortcutPath = Join-Path -Path $publicDesktopPath -ChildPath \u0026#39;NameOfLink.lnk\u0026#39; # Remove Old lnk if it exists (For Link Updates with same Link name.) if (Test-Path -Path $shortcutPath) { Remove-Item -Path $shortcutPath -Force Write-Output \u0026#34;Old shortcut removed: $shortcutPath\u0026#34; } else { Write-Output \u0026#34;No existing shortcut found at: $shortcutPath\u0026#34; } # Drop an icon with the .ico extention in the same directory the script will run from. # Define the source and destination paths $icoPath = \u0026#34;NameOfLink.ico\u0026#34; $icoDestinationPath = \u0026#34;$env:ProgramFiles\\Samily\\Icons\\NameOfLink.ico\u0026#34; # Create the destination directory if it does not exist $destinationDir = [System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($icoDestinationPath) if (-not (Test-Path -Path $destinationDir)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $destinationDir } # Copy the file to the destination Copy-Item -Path $icoPath -Destination $icoDestinationPath -Force # Verify the file was copied if (Test-Path -Path $icoDestinationPath) { Write-Output \u0026#34;File copied successfully to $icoDestinationPath\u0026#34; } else { Write-Output \u0026#34;Failed to copy the file.\u0026#34; } $WshShell = New-Object -comObject WScript.Shell $Shortcut = $WshShell.CreateShortcut(\u0026#34;$shortcutPath\u0026#34;) $Shortcut.TargetPath = \u0026#34;%SystemDrive%\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\u0026#34; $Shortcut.Arguments = \u0026#34;/C start `\u0026#34;`\u0026#34; /min `\u0026#34;%SystemDrive%\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe`\u0026#34; --app=$($websiteURL) --start-windowed\u0026#34; $Shortcut.IconLocation = \u0026#34;$icoDestinationPath\u0026#34; $Shortcut.Save() How the Script Works #The script performs the following steps:\nURL Definition: The URL of the webpage to be opened is stored in the $websiteURL variable. Desktop Path: The path to the public desktop folder is obtained. Shortcut Path: The path where the shortcut will be created is defined. Start Logging: A log file is created to record the process. Remove Old Shortcut: If a shortcut with the same name already exists, it is removed. Copy Icon File: An icon file is copied to the destination directory. Create Shortcut: A new shortcut is created that opens the defined URL in an Edge window. Stop Logging: Logging is stopped. Customization Options #The script can be easily customized by changing the following variables:\n$websiteURL: The URL of the webpage to be opened. $shortcutPath: The path where the shortcut will be created. $logFile: The path to the log file. $icoPath and $icoDestinationPath: Paths to the icon file. Conclusion #This PowerShell script provides a simple way to create a desktop shortcut that opens a webpage in a \u0026ldquo;Fake\u0026rdquo; Edge App window. It is particularly useful for users who frequently access specific web applications and want seamless integration into their desktop environment. With a few adjustments, the script can be easily tailored to individual needs.\nAnd best of it: It can be installed as an .intuneWin App.\n","date":"25 July 2024","permalink":"/posts/fake-edge-app/","section":"Posts","summary":"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.","title":"Fake Edge App: A PowerShell Script to Create a Web App Shortcut"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/intune/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Intune"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/powershell/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PowerShell"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/powershell/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"PowerShell"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"About Us #Welcome to our blog!
